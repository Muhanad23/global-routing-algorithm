\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper we want to improve routing by improving global routing, this
 can be done by using A-Star algorithm, which will reduce time taken in
 this process and achieve the minimum wire length, many comparisons are
 taken in this paper with different algorithms to find the optimum algorithm
 to be used to achieve both minimum wire length and minimum time taken.
 From the comparisons of the paper we can find that using any algorithm
 is a trade off as when we decrease time taken, the wire length is increased
 and vice versa, so we cannot find an algorithm which is better from the
 other algorithms in general but we can say that using A-Star algorithm
 is a good approach to be used in global routing as it decreases the routing
 time however it is not the the best achieveable time but it is better than
 many other algorithms, and it is the best algorithm to achieve the minimum
 wire length with this complexity.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scheduling is a crucial part of many real-time applications such as scheduling
 airlines and railways communications, product manufacturing processes,
 data packets routing in computer networks and pipe networks.
 Operating systems multiprocessing environments are no different from those
 mediums mentioned, where processes compete over CPU utilization.
 This brought to existence the need for scheduling algorithms to justly
 assign processes to available CPUs in favour of optimizing performance
 measures, in particular, to maximize overall CPU utilization and throughput,
 and to minimize response time, waiting time and turnaround time.
 A schedular could be preemptive where it can temporarily interrupt a process
 without its cooperation and assign the CPU resources to a different process
 with the intention to assign them back to the former process, such operation
 is called context switching, or it could be non-preemptive (cooperative)
 by not being able to context switch between processes.
 Various preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling disciplines exist such
 as, first come, first serve (FCFS), shortest job first (SJF), shortest
 remaining time first (SRTF), round-robin (RR), multilevel queue and multilevel
 feedback queue.
 In FCFS, processes are non-preemptively executed according to their arrival
 time.
 In SJF, the CPU is assigned to the process with the smallest burst time.
 SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF where at each iteration, the process
 with the least remaining burst time takes control of the CPU.
 Round-robin preemptively assigns the CPU to each process in the ready queue
 for a static amount of time called quantum and executes them in an FCFS
 fashion.
 Multilevel queue algorithm partitions the ready queue into several queues
 to which processes are perpetually assigned and are executed according
 to another scheduling algorithm (e.g.
 RR).
 Processes cannot move from one queue to another.
 However, in a multilevel feedback queue algorithm, processes that don't
 terminate in one queue, due to having CPU burst time more than the time
 quantum assigned to their particular queue, are shifted to a lower priority
 queue.
 Due to the fact that long processes eventually sink to the lowest priority
 queue, they are conventionally carried out using FCFS to prevent starvation.
 Several papers discuss different methods to optimize the algorithms mentioned,
 each come with their set of advantages and drawbacks.
 One of many is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, whose approach achieves better average response time but at the cost of
 hindering the scheduling process due to recalculating time quantum for
 each queue using a recurrent neural network.
 In this paper, we attempted to implement the best of all worlds.

\begin_layout Section
Related Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several papers proposed various types of approaches to improve the overall
 efficiency of the multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm.
 The chosen quantum time for each queue plays a major role.
 Hence, it is essential to choose a proper method to compute the time quantum
 value to minimize response time and maximize overall performance.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "b2"

\end_inset

, an algorithm is introduced for minimizing the response time.
 In this algorithm, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to determine
 both the number of queues and the optimized time quantum value for each
 queue.
 The RNN generates an effective model to compute the time quantum value.
 Their proposed intelligent version of the MLFQ offers good results, however,
 it suffers from a few drawbacks, the first being the direct proportionality
 of its network learning time and the amount of input data, and the second
 is the possibility of experiencing initial overhead at the first iterations
 of the algorithm.
 Our approach proposes an improved version of MLFQ that utilizes an altered
 version of RR named shortest remaining burst round-robin (SRBRR) introduced
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "b3"

\end_inset

 which avoids the cost of learning time and overhead time in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "b2"

\end_inset

.
 Regarding the various approaches to improve the MLFQ algorithm, those attempts
 dealt with starvation by assigning different quantum values to the ready
 queues depending on their priority.
 Our approach also deals with starvation by boosting processes from lower
 priority queues to higher ones according to certain criteria.

\begin_layout Section
Proposed Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm, three parameters are
 considered.
 The first is the chosen scheduling algorithm for each queue, especially
 the last queue as its scheduling algorithm is expected to treat starvation.
 The second is the criteria according to which a process is promoted, this
 technique is also known as Aging.
 The third is the criteria according to which a process is demoted.
 In our proposed algorithm, there are 5 queues sorted in ascending order
 in line with their priority number, 1 being the highest priority and 5
 being the lowest.
 Each queue uses a modified version of the round-robin scheduling algorithm
 stated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "b3"

\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "b3"

\end_inset

, processes are sorted in ascending order according to their burst time
 and are assigned a time quantum that equals the median burst time of those
 processes.
 This algorithm provides better turnaround time and waiting time than the
 standard static quantum RR algorithm whose quantum, if set too short, leads
 to many context switches and, if set too long, morphs the algorithm into
 an FCFS algorithm.
 The proposed alteration on the stated algorithm in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "b3"

\end_inset

 is that each queue quantum time equals the median burst time multiplied
 by a factor matching the queue number.
 Hence, the gradual increase of quantum time as priority decreases.
 For clarification, a queue with priority equal 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 has the following processes denoted by their burst time: 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $300$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $550$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $600$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $620$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $700$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $720$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $900$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1200$
\end_inset

, the median value is 
\begin_inset Formula $620$
\end_inset

, since we are in a queue whose priority equals 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, therefore the quantum slice value according to the proposed approach equals
 
\begin_inset Formula $1240$
\end_inset

 as in 
\begin_inset Formula $620*2$
\end_inset

.
 If processes of a certain queue didn't terminate after assigning the quantum
 time value, they are shifted to the next lower priority queue.
 After introducing new processes into a queue, the quantum time slice is
 recalculated.
 Processes age whenever they are in a queue whose priority is one less than
 that currently getting scheduled and satisfies the following inequality:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{waiting\;time\;of\;P}{burst\;time\;of\;P}>=1\label{eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those procedures are repeated for all the generated queues until all processes
 reach the lowest priority queue where they are rescheduled until their
 completion.

\begin_layout Standard
we implement global routing with A_Star router algorithm in c++ language
 with Rsyn to parse input test cases files with format LEF/DEF.
 All experiments are perfromed on a Machine with 2 GHZ intel Processor and
 8 GB RAM.
 our algorithm is focus on three important factors :total wire-lenght, channel
 congestion ,number of vias.
 Our target is to minimize a convex combination of the total wire-lenght
 and the number of vias that represent the bends in the tree that result
 in solving the net of pins to be connected.our test cases input are all
 from ICCAD'19 contest for global routing.we test our code with different
 heurestic function -that affect the run time of A*- to check its effect
 on CPU time.our concern is on wire-lengh and number of vias result from
 routing.

\begin_layout Standard
we compare results of our algorithm which focus on factors - total wire-lenght,n
umber of vias in the routing results - with TripleZ and NTUidRoute algorithms
 in ICCAD'19 [Table 1] .threads number used in all cases is 8 threads.
 score used as unit to compare ,score of wire length is a function of metal
 pitch and wire length and weight:

Conclusion and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this paper is to tackle different shortcomings associated with
 the standard MLFQ scheduling algorithm as well as its variants discussed
 in several papers.
 To resolve these deficiencies, we introduced different adjustable policies
 and techniques.
 It is evidently clear that those methods yield better CPU performance and
 optimize utilization by reducing the average waiting time as well as the
 average turnaround time.
 Despite experimenting numerous combinations of the parameters and scheduling
 policies by which the proposed MLFQ algorithm operates, we can say that
 there is yet a large room for experiment and improvement through finding
 better methods and policies which would make the algorithm more adaptable
 to the nature of the submitted processes and overall more enhanced.
 For instance, adjusting the criteria by which the schedular decides whether
 to promote a process might further lessen starvation.
 Making the proposed algorithm preemptive might also aid mitigating starvation
 and render overall better performance.
 The possibilities are limitless.
