\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper VLSI routing is improved by improving global routing, this
 can be done by using A-Star with heuristic cost function that has parameters
 which affect the time taken by the router on changing instead of Dijkstra's
 algorithm in finding path, which will reduce time taken in this process
 and achieve the minimum wirelength, many comparisons are taken in this
 paper with different algorithms to find the optimum algorithm to be used
 to achieve both minimum wirelength and minimum time taken.
 From the comparisons of the paper we can find that using any algorithm
 is a trade off as when time taken is decreased, the wirelength is increased
 and vice versa, so there is no algorithm which is better from the other
 algorithms in general but using A-Star algorithm with the heuristic function
 in finding path is a good approach to be used in global routing as it decreases
 the routing time and achieve the minimum wirelength.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Routing is critical step in physical design process.
 Until now the optimum solution for VLSI routing has not been achieved yet,
 so it is considered as a very interesting challenging field.
 It is exactly done in two steps, global routing and detailed routing.
 At first global routing is run which is the responsible for making an approxima
te routing for the whole circuit in order to be used as a guide for detailed
 routing, then the detailed routing is run to make the exact routing for
 the system.
 That means if global or detailed routing is improved the whole routing
 process is improved, but there are many problems that have to be overcame
 to make a correct routing process.
 First of all the scale has to be taken into consideration, as millions
 of wires exist in a small chip area which means that many kilometers of
 wires are placed in a very small area, so wetotal wirelength has to be
 minimized as much as possible, also it is known that as the wirelength
 increases the resistance increases as well which means more delay in the
 chip.
 There is another problem as circuits are made in nano-scale which means
 that its geometric will be complex.
 Another problem is that routing algorithm have to be applicable for more
 than one layer with different costs.
 The direction of wires also have to taken into consideration as the direction
 of wires in every layer can be either vertical or horizontal and no diagonal
 paths, then to go from source 'S' to target 'T' the path taken should be
 in (vertical | horizontal) directions that specified by the layer (at each
 layer wires are placed in one direction only), then there is another problem
 as when a wire goes from layer to another to continue on the perpendicular
 direction it have to go through via which have a high resistance.
 DFM (design for manufacturer) rules also has to be achieved.
 All of these constraints must be taken into consideration with the global
 routing to achieve hundred percent of the circuit connections, that means
 global routing will take a lot of time to achieve all these constraints,
 and here is the challenge to achieve all the routing specifications with
 minimum time taken.

 shows a very simple approach of how the global router works.
 At (a) the source and target of both (A,B) need to be connected ignoring
 obstacles, nevertheless we can observe that the global router have to iterate
 to get the best routing paths, at (b) (B,B) connected but there is no way
 to connect (A,A) as when (B,B) connected together they blocked the way
 for (A,A) to be connected, after some iterations we can find the figure
 at (c) in which (A,A) and (B,B) connected correctly, but there is a problem,
 the (A,A) connection is not the optimal path as there are paths which achieve
 less wirelength, so the global router have to iterate until reaching the
 optimal path.
 These iterations are done for only two connections in one layer without
 obstacles, then how about millions of wires in VLSI? this shows how much
 the global routing algorithm has to be very fast in order to connect this
 huge number of wires as fast as possible.

Several papers proposed various types of approaches to improve the routing
 process, each of them tried to improve the overall routing by improving
 one or more parameters, some paperes tried to decrease number of vias,
 other papers tried to decrease the time taken and so on.

 they used a sequential global routing and they provided two bounded length
 maze algorithms as finding path algorithms in order to make the router
 faster and to avoid congestions thus avoiding overflow, the first one is
 optimal-BLMR and the second one is heuristic-BLMR.
 optimal-BLMR is used to get the minimum cost paths to be used as a routing
 paths, this can be done in three steps.
 First BLC (bounded length constraint) is defined as a grater number than
 Manhattan distance then to go from source to target the neighbour points
 are tested if it can be a part of path or not, each point that violates
 the BLC constraint is discarded.
 Second if the route started from point 
\shape italic
v
\shape default
 and ended at point 
\shape italic
u
\shape default
 and there was many paths between these two points, the normal maze algorithm
 wwill take the path with minimum cost which may cause the route get into
 congestions, bun in optimal-BLMR they keep track of all paths between these
 two points in order to choose the path that will not cause overflow, it
 iterates on the minimum cost path everytime and if it found a suitable
 path it reserves that path otherwise it discard that path.
 Third step the optimal-BLMR iterates on the reserved paths and choose the
 one to be used for routing.
 In heuristic-BLMR they tried to speed the router up by reserving only one
 path between the two points, but they also wanted to keep the advantage
 of optimal-BLMR (avoidng congestions) and this can be achieved by choosing
 the selected path only if the wirelength is enough to detour around congested
 regions.
 The advantages of this paper are using sequential global routing which
 is based on multithreaded global routing which speedup the router, avoiding
 collision by using optimal-BLMR, and making a fast and nearly avoiding
 collision algorithm (heuristic-BLMR).
 But there are some disadvanatges too, as optimal-BLMR is very slow to be
 used, although heuristic-BLMR is faster than optimal-BLMR its results are
 not accurate as the wirelength is not the best compared with other papers.

Experimental Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
we implement global routing with A_Star router algorithm in c++ language
 with Rsyn to parse input test cases files with format LEF/DEF.
 All experiments are perfromed on a Machine with 2 GHZ intel Processor and
 8 GB RAM.
 our algorithm is focus on three important factors :total wire-lenght, channel
 congestion ,number of vias.
 Our target is to minimize a convex combination of the total wire-lenght
 and the number of vias that represent the bends in the tree that result
 in solving the net of pins to be connected.our test cases input are all
 from ICCAD'19 contest for global routing.we test our code with different
 heurestic function -that affect the run time of A*- to check its effect
 on CPU time.our concern is on wire-lengh and number of vias result from
 routing.

that heurestric function affect run time of router ,decreases it to be lower
 than dijkstra router's run time in many test cases.
 run time changes with the change of heuristic function constants.
 we notice that higher constants increase the run time and sometimes be
 greater than dijkstra router's runtime.
 Heurestic function 2 has ovarall results which is good than others herestics
 function, with other Heurestic functions run time may improve mostly.

Conclusion and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this paper is to develop A-star-based global Router with minimum
 wirelength and number of vias as the more vias number the more heat generated
 from the chip with minimum run time.to overcome the time problem we use
 heurestic function that decrease the run time of router and test it with
 different constants to define its affect on run time ,for future work we
 aim to define effective heurestic function to improve run time and using
 more effecient versions of A_star algorithm such as bi-directional A-star
 ,deep A-star,iterative deeping A-star .for instance bi-directional A-star
 that process edges in both directions that improve run time.
